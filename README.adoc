== About App
*GreenerMe* is an educational Android app about recycling and environmental sustainability
targeted at youths in Singapore. It provides straightforward information on what can or cannot be recycled and how to do so with one simple search,
and raises awareness about the environmental problems today in an engaging and motivating way through weekly quizzes. Users can
earn points from these quizzes, which can be used to redeem prizes.

Singapore's household recycling rates are reported to be only around 20%, and our only landfill, Pulau Semakau, is slated
to run out of space by 2035 at our current rate of producing waste. We can definitely do more to foster and practise green habits - and be a greener me!

* As a person who does not know how to recycle his / her item, I want to easily get the procedure for recycling the item.
* As a person who cannot be bothered to recycle due to lack of knowledge, I want to easily overcome this barrier.

== How we are different from similar apps
=== myEnv (by NEA):
* Lack of focus on recycling
** Too many other features such as weather and air quality which dilutes the attention on the 3Rs and recycling in particular
** Information provided is not targeted to recycling
** Does not actively promote recycling programmes
* Not user-friendly in terms of finding information and app design
* Lack of details regarding whether a specific item can be recycled

=== Recycle!
Provides a collection calendar, collections points and a sorting guide

* Only applies to Belgium, not relevant to Singapore
* Other countries have similar initiatives but not seen in Singapore

=== Others
Some other apps generally focus on how items can be recycled or reused to make into other things, rather than
informing users on what specifically can or cannot be recycled and how to do so.
